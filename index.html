            <h3>Watch at Youtube: https://tinyurl.com/admissions-open-house</h3>
            <p>The four separate program-specific events—one for each of the School’s areas of graduate study in Sculpture,
            Painting/Printmaking, Graphic Design, and Photography—are available online in six edited videos. Beginning with an
            introduction to MFA admissions across the School of Art, the 2021 Admissions Open House playlist then contains the
            program-specific information featuring each department’s faculty and students before concluding with an informational
            session on financial aid.
            We recommend that interested applicants watch the first video, “Dean’s Welcome & Preparing Your Application,” followed
            by the video(s) specific to the programs they’re interested in applying to, and conclude with “Financing Your
            Education.”
            All applications for Fall 2022 must be submitted no later than 11:59:59 PM EST on Wednesday, January 5, 2022</p>

            <h1>COMMUNITY BOARD</h1>
            <h3>Faculty/Alumni : Post your art internships for undergrads</h3>
            <p>The Yale Arts Apprenticeship Program is an initiative that connects Yale undergraduates, particularly those on financial
            aid, with professional arts practitioners of any discipline. As an option within Yale’s Summer Experience Award (SEA)
            funding model, the Arts Apprenticeship must fulfill the same basic requirements. Additional details, as well as those
            specific to the Arts Apprenticeship are included below. Yale faculty, alumni, or other arts practitioners interested in
            featuring positions through the program should contact Yale’s Creative Careers advisor. Which Opportunities are
            Eligible? Must be at least 30 hours/week, for at least 8-weeks over the summer months. Those 8-weeks do not have to be
            continuous if the mentoring Arts Practitioner agrees on a different schedule. The time commitment need not all be in
            direct contact with the Arts Practitioner. Independent projects, tasks, research, etc. can comprise much of the
            experience, as long as the Arts Practitioner is checking in regularly with the student to provide oversight and
            career-based context.</p>
